The solution often involves systematically checking the following:

1. **Dependency versions:** Ensure all dependencies (including native modules) are compatible with the current Expo SDK version. Check for conflicting versions or outdated packages using `npm ls` or `yarn why`.
2. **Webpack configuration:** If you have a custom `webpack.config.js`, carefully examine it for potential issues.  Look for misconfigurations that might conflict with the default Expo build process.
3. **Native modules:** If you're using native modules, make sure they are properly configured and linked to your project. Follow the instructions provided by each module's documentation.  
4. **Clean build:** Sometimes, a clean build can resolve unexpected issues. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `dist` folders and reinstalling your dependencies.
5. **Expo Diagnostics:** Use the `expo diagnostics` command to get information about your project setup that can aid in debugging.
6. **Console logs:**  Add console logs to your build process to identify where the error occurs, or use a debugging tool to step through the build process. 
7. **Check Expo forums & documentation:** Look for similar issues on the Expo forums and in the Expo documentation for help.  Specific error messages can often be found in these resources.

# Cryptic Expo CLI Build Errors

This repository demonstrates an example of uncommon errors encountered when using Expo CLI with a project that has a custom build process or misconfigured dependencies.  The errors are often cryptic and difficult to debug due to the lack of specific error messages. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Try to run `expo start`

You'll likely encounter an error during the build process. 

## Solution

The solution file (`expoBugSolution.js`) demonstrates how to resolve this issue by carefully reviewing dependencies, configurations, and the build process itself.
